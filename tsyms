USDT

## A single base for the pair should be on line 1.  Work through one base, then switch to another base if you want more.
## So do the top 100 crypto to USDT pairs, then do the top 100 crypto to XDC pairs for example. The database will keep track
## of what you have already created.

## NOTE: Not all feeds support all bases.  For example, tl_binance will NOT work with fiat base like USD.  Always test the process
## on an apothem node if you want to keep your validator clean and tidy.
